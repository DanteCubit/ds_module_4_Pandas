# ds_module_4_pandas_challenge
I will analyze district-wide standardized test results.

Started with two data sets and then pd.merge them into one DataFrame

From there, I calculated key metrics about the schools and students in the district from the DataFrames.

Then using the DataFrames, I analyzed data results to find observable trends through the district.
